### What I learned

I had previously learnt DOM manipulation in jaascript but i was able to understand new methods while working on this project, I learnt a different way of using the vlue of an input form as an innertext for another element. 



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
